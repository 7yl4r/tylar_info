Attempting to clone the CalCOFI server to see if we can reuse the docker config.

```
git clone git@github.com:CalCOFI/server.git
echo 'PASSWORD=Cc!' > .env

# docker launch as daemon
docker compose up -d
```

Found and fixed a simple syntax error in the docker-compose.yaml.
Then ran out of disk space on my laptop.
