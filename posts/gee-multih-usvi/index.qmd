Working with Chelsea Bryant today to import some satellite-derived benthic species data into google earth engine.
I have done similar things before with Rookery Bay and Jobos Bay NERRS so I want to reuse some methods.
I didn't do a good job documenting things last time so I hope to improve that along the way.

I dug into the various scripts and was not able to make any progress.
I forgot to take notes here; I will have to come back to this later.
