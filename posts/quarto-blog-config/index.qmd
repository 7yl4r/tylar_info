Created a template for posts and a cheatsheet I can copy-paste from for this blog.
Looked at using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for creating the post but decided that was overkill.
The project focuses mostly on whole-directory templates; I think using jinja might be the preferred way to handle single files.
