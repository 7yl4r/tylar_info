January is a good time to find manatees in the springs so let's plan a trip.

It is a 1h47m drive according to [gmaps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St.+Petersburg,+FL/Rainbow+River,+Florida+34432).

Most convenietly located FL WMA is Potts Preserve. 
It is a 30m drive from the campsite to Rainbow River.

For campsites I checked
* hipcamp
* reserveAmerica
* the above linked WMA map

I got overwhelmed, gave up trying to find a SWFMD spot, and just booked at the official Rainbow River Campground.
