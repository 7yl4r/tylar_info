I am brainstorming presentation ideas.

Here is a list of titles:
1. Scientific Method 2.0 : applied scientific modeling in the age of AI
2. data about data :
3. finding your niche in the machine : systems engineering principles
4. Reclaim your data : Personal OpSec & Data management advice
5. How to speak computer : Machine Learning, systems engineering, code languages, and magic

Here is a list of slide ideas:
  * underfitting, overfitting issues are pervasive
  * tech secret vendor lock-in
  * what is data, what is metadata?
  * hash functions + content addressable file systems
  * the semantic web
  * UML diagramming
  * user interface design
  * the linux philosophy
  * DRY
  * personal blogging & "research journaling"

Here is a diagram where I tried getting at the different states of product development with the intention of talking about vendor lock-in and the incentives put onto code "owners".

leaseCode("sell use of \n the magic")

demoCode("give away the magic")

start --> writeCode

writeCode --> leaseCode --> writeCode

```

I am stuck at how to represent different levels of solution obfuscation and data harvesting in this diagram and I think I have lost sight of the purpose of this diagram.
I need to take a step back and reconnect with what I want to communicate.

Here is a bulleted list that inexplicably feels relevant:
* data 
* metadata ontologies rely on a common semantic understanding
  * the problem of naming things
* the "semantic web" makes the source of our shared understanding explicit
* LLMs include mathematically encoded semantics

But what do I really want to communicate to anybody doing research?
* The importance of establishing trusted sources of information.
* Remembering your inability to perceive an objective reality

Here is a screenplay:

EXT.  UNIVERSE - DARK

A pure black screen.

NARRATOR
This is a representation of the universe.
In this representation the information needed to explain everything is stored entirely in time.
We can sit here and let I can talk for an infinite amount of time until I have explained everything to you but it is not much to look at.
Let's convert some of the information into space.

A single white speck pops into existence in the center of the screen.

NARRATOR
A single point in space existing only for the tiniest infinitesimal of time.
That point has no meaningful spatial dimensions, but we have made it a little bigger so you can see it.
This is a unified grand theory looks like in spacetime.
One single piece of raw data that we can plug into a time equation that would define everything yet to happen to this point.
The realities of space and time are intertwined in ways that render the universe computationally irreducible.
This is not a model of all space and time as viewed from an omnipotent persepective.
This is a model of everything as it is viewed from a conscious perspective - filling not both space *and* time - but filling space *or* time.

The speck grows into a circular white line.
As the circle grows it begins fading from bright white into hues into red and blue representing hotter and colder areas in the cosmic microwave background.
The circle stops growing.

NARRATOR
This circle has spatial dimension because we have used up some time to create it.
You have observed the passage of time, the expansion of space, and now your reference frame is no longer that of a single point.
The representational model we created is stored in the color of the points along the circle.
See the whole circle all at once by focusing on the center but percieving the outer limits.
Focus your perspective on a single point along the edge to inspect it more closely.
Hold in your mind this single spatial frame of reference.
Be the circle.

The circle disappears.

NARRATOR
...and whatever else time has in store.
