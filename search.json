I posted on the discord of the “Lit” framework (my current favorite web components community) but nobody has replied.\nI went down a long rabbit hole trying to figure out how to build this thing, then decided that running the data through an AI would be better than getting all caught up on how to structure the data.\nThis feels like a pointless exercise I have gone through countless times over the last year or five; every time I start building something it gets more and more complex until I am overwhelmed. Trying to figure out the best way to build the user experience keeps landing me at AI and mesh-networked-IoTs. Those topics remain too big for me to tackle until I have collaborators. And so… I give up and go try to make my space more presentable. I am no longer able to maintain focus without another active participant and this stuff is way too far removed from anyone I know.\nBelow are a bunch of disjointed things I wrote while trying to get my thoughts together.\n\nHere is a lil sales pitch:\nYour personal reviews and recommendations are of more value today than ever.\nThis project allows you to reclaim ownership over that data.\nRecommend the works you trust, give discounts to your friends, and take commission for your influences.\n\nHere are the user stories for the minimum viable product:\n\nFind my preferred product supplier\n\nUser states: I want X\nSystem asks: Who do you trust about X?\n\nPublish an opinion\n\n\n\n\nWho do you trust to ask for a recommendation on X?\nNetwork of trusted suppliers, where each “supplier”\n\nI want to eliminate the process of getting multiple pricing quotes from untrusted suppliers.\n\nTo reduce that goal down a bit: I want to record my opinions about products I have viewed and reviewed so that I can order them again or share them with friends.

    "text": "Working to install shore power on the bus today. I wired up the following circuit\nmain --&gt; 30A_fuse --&gt; breaker_box --&gt; outlet\nAfter flipping it on I got not power at the outlet. The main tested working; there are no indicator lights on the fuse or breaker to help me debug. I have decided to try going through the fuse to the victron because it has indicator lights.\nAfter inspecting the AC in & AC out connections it looks as though I need a particular type of connector. note: I later found this was not the case. The manual does not specify what kind of connector it is. In this forum post acs calls it a “GST18 connector”. I have the 50A variant of the multiplus-II with 4-wire split-phase connectors but all the diagrams and photos I am seeing have 3-wire; I have the wrong manual. I am feeling anxious about connecting the unit without the 4th wire; I do not know if it was designed to function this way. I found the right manual and it does indeed say “The AC input can be supplied from a split-phase 120/240V source or a single-phase 120V source.” A big sigh of relief for that. I found a great install video here. Turns out these are “spring connectors” that the wire actually can go into directly."

I need to take a step back and reconnect with what I want to communicate.\nHere is a bulleted list that inexplicably feels relevant: * data * metadata ontologies rely on a common semantic understanding * the problem of naming things * the “semantic web” makes the source of our shared understanding explicit * LLMs include mathematically encoded semantics\nBut what do I really want to communicate to anybody doing research? * The importance of establishing trusted sources of information. * Remembering your inability to perceive an objective reality\nHere is a screenplay:\nEXT.  UNIVERSE - DARK\n\nA pure black screen.\n\nNARRATOR\nThis is a representation of the universe.\nIn this representation the information needed to explain everything is stored entirely in time.\nWe can sit here and let I can talk for an infinite amount of time until I have explained everything to you but it is not much to look at.\nLet's convert some of the information into space.\n\nA single white speck pops into existence in the center of the screen.\n\nNARRATOR\nA single point in space existing only for the tiniest infinitesimal of time.\nThat point has no meaningful spatial dimensions, but we have made it a little bigger so you can see it.\nThis is a unified grand theory looks like in spacetime.\nOne single piece of raw data that we can plug into a time equation that would define everything yet to happen to this point.\nThe realities of space and time are intertwined in ways that render the universe computationally irreducible.\nThis is not a model of all space and time as viewed from an omnipotent persepective.\nThis is a model of everything as it is viewed from a conscious perspective - filling not both space *and* time - but filling space *or* time.\n\nThe speck grows into a circular white line.\nAs the circle grows it begins fading from bright white into hues into red and blue representing hotter and colder areas in the cosmic microwave background.\nThe circle stops growing.\n\nNARRATOR\nThis circle has spatial dimension because we have used up some time to create it.\nYou have observed the passage of time, the expansion of space, and now your reference frame is no longer that of a single point.\nThe representational model we created is stored in the color of the points along the circle.\nSee the whole circle all at once by focusing on the center but percieving the outer limits.\nFocus your perspective on a single point along the edge to inspect it more closely.\nHold in your mind this single spatial frame of reference.\nBe the circle.\n\nThe circle disappears.\n\nNARRATOR\n...and whatever else time has in store.\n\nRevisiting this 2024-01-07 and I wrote the following:\n\nTrust and Citations in Academic Publishing: Workshop Guide\n\n\ncommand line basics\nAn introduction to command-line interfaces and basic POSIX commands.

A guide to implementing best practices in data analysis, including documentation, version control, and sharing code and data.\nhow to cite a superintelligence : why we cite\nscience-&gt; know (Latin) skepticism-&gt;search (Greek) cite -&gt;call (Latin)\nscientific thinking means having a huge amount of skepticism. trust absolutely only what your own data says. if you are to trust words, then you must establish sufficient shared experience. the most trustworthy scientific claims are ones you can and have tested yourself.\nAn ideal scientific publication makes one specific claim so well that any reader would be convinced, and so concisely that it would be an entertaining read.\nProblem: audience. We must rely on shared experiences to establish trust. This works best if you mostly already agree with the author. Citations can be used as a way to establish trust by citing authors, publishers, or results that the reader already agrees with. Word choice and use of familiar jargon can also establish a sense of shared experience with the reader.\nProblem: data. We must always be skeptical of data. Do we trust those who collected and published it? Can we collect it ourselves?\nHeuristic: - citing a person. means you have evaluated the trustworthiness of a person. - citing an org says I trust everyone in this org and the mechanations of the org - citing an AI says I trust everyone who contributed to the training data and the modeling method being used\nfact citation provenance\ntypes of citations • define a term (see here for clarification) • substantiate a claim (see here for justification) • data source (see here for raw data) • code\nAs a reader I want to __ so that __ - lookup the definition of a term - investigate the legitimacy of a claim - reproduce some results presented -"
