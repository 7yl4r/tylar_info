The main tested working; there are no indicator lights on the fuse or breaker to help me debug. I have decided to try going through the fuse to the victron because it has indicator lights.\nAfter inspecting the AC in & AC out connections it looks as though I need a particular type of connector. note: I later found this was not the case. The manual does not specify what kind of connector it is. In this forum post acs calls it a “GST18 connector”. I have the 50A variant of the multiplus-II with 4-wire split-phase connectors but all the diagrams and photos I am seeing have 3-wire; I have the wrong manual. I am feeling anxious about connecting the unit without the 4th wire; I do not know if it was designed to function this way. I found the right manual and it does indeed say “The AC input can be supplied from a split-phase 120/240V source or a single-phase 120V source.” A big sigh of relief for that."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I had the “opportunity” to spend many hours alone with my own thoughts over the last month. I spent much of the time imagining how I would transmit a signal if I were wanting to contact aliens. What I came up with may not be particularly novel since I am not a signal processing expert but hopefully this writing won’t upset my grad school professors on the subject too much.\nWe start with a repeating signal to give us a method of synchronizing clocks between locations. A more capable civilization might modulate the wavelet of a pulsar but my soft human meat brain likes to imagine a sine wave to serve as this timing wave. From this wave we can easily detect a frequency (f) and express it as a period (T).\nMy idea from there is to capture the residual fluctuations over the wave and average them. For symmetrical waves like sinusoidal waves the first half of the wave can be added to the second half (half-period residual modulation detection). But in general any given wavelet would be differenced from the next to produce a set of residuals (full period residual modulation detection).\nAs far as I know this is not something that can be accomplished with analog signal processing. The signal must be stored for at least the full period T and then combined with the next wavelet instance. The collection and storage of the signal will have a certain bitrate, which must be higher than the timing wave. It is not clear to me what bitrate would be the ideal choice for a given timing frequency. Bigger always seems better but I remain uncertain how to encode universally interpretable information in a time series, regardless of the bitrate. One ideal would be to transmit a signal with similar meaning at multiple bitrates - a lower resolution vs a higher resolution of the same meaning. Could the antenna bandwidth characteristics somehow imply an ideal bitrate? Maybe there is something to be figured related to the maximum throughput or channel capacity of the proposed signal processing paradigm. Or perhaps using a known distance to the transmitter could give you a sense of what sampling frequency would be reasonable to expect.\nAnyway, this is how I would get started if I was leading a new SETI project. Aim something at a pulsar and start crunching on this.\n\n\n\nwavelet_residual_am_image"

    "text": "Tonight I am wondering on why my recent “SineWave Residual Modulation” might be useful and I think it has something to do with “trust” or… more enigmatically stated: “shared language”. Supersampling a sinusoidal signal and finding a steady signal in the residuals could be a way to encrypt information. Any swath of spacetime where the lower-frequency timing signal would be detectable would have access to the key, and messages on higher-frequencies could be decrypted using that key. The supersampling frequency would be the same as the new recieving frequency.\nBut also maybe I am having some confusion about how the antenna systems work. I am trying to read about “Software Defined Radio” but still struggling with some concepts.\nAn antenna (or perhaps more accurately, an RF Frontend) is designed to pick up ((and/or?) transmit) a specific frequency. At this selected frequency a signal is detected and can be captured as a time-series. The processing I am referring to takes place within a detected periodic signal within this time-series. It is confusing to describe but I think a lower-frequency pattern can be transmitted in a higher-frequency medium. Imagine tuning to a radio station and hearing a single tone. But then within this tone would be tiny variations between each wave period. These variations could be processed using the methods from my previous post and the message found as sampled at the frequency of the analog-to-digital converter.\nThe frequency of the A2D converter could then be used as a broadcast frequency on which to broadcast messages encrypted by the message found on the original radio station.\nWe can imagine a system of “major stations” with the power to broadcast & recieve widely a signal, and “minor stations” which operate more locally.\n\n\n\nmesh depcition\n\n\nA “Major station” signal can act as decoding key for minor station signals.\nlow freq message can be used to encrypt higher freq messages.\nmulti-frequency stations input higher-freq messages and choose to continue outputting current message or begin rebroadcasting message from higher-freq transmitting neighbor.\nSo here we have a “trustless” ham radio encryption system? Little stations can speak to each other while blessed by the wider transmission. Stations outside of the spacetime covered by the major station will only be able to understand other minor stations if they have memory of the major station transmission."

Scientific Method 2.0 : applied scientific modeling in the age of AI 2. data about data : 3. finding your niche in the machine : systems engineering principles 4. Reclaim your data : Personal OpSec & Data management advice 5. How to speak computer : Machine Learning, systems engineering, code languages, and magic\nHere is a list of slide ideas: * underfitting, overfitting issues are pervasive * tech secret vendor lock-in * what is data, what is metadata? * hash functions + content addressable file systems * the semantic web * UML diagramming * user interface design * the linux philosophy * DRY * personal blogging & “research journaling”\nHere is a diagram where I tried getting at the different states of product development with the intention of talking about vendor lock-in and the incentives put onto code “owners”.\n---\ntitle: State Diagram for a Digital Products Creators\n---\ngraph TD\n\nstart((startup))\n%% MVP addresses &gt;=1 use case\nwriteCode(\"working on the magic\")\nsellCode(\"sold the magic\")\n\nleaseCode(\"sell use of \\n the magic\")\n\ndemoCode(\"give away the magic\")\n\n%% ======\nstart --&gt; writeCode\n\nwriteCode --&gt; sellCode\n\nwriteCode --&gt; leaseCode --&gt; writeCode\n\nwriteCode --&gt; demoCode --&gt; writeCode\nI am stuck at how to represent different levels of solution obfuscation and data harvesting in this diagram and I think I have lost sight of the purpose of this diagram. I need to take a step back and reconnect with what I want to communicate.\nHere is a bulleted list that inexplicably feels relevant: * data * metadata ontologies rely on a common semantic understanding * the problem of naming things * the “semantic web” makes the source of our shared understanding explicit * LLMs include mathematically encoded semantics\nBut what do I really want to communicate to anybody doing research? * The importance of establishing trusted sources of information. * Remembering your inability to perceive an objective reality\nHere is a screenplay:\nEXT.  UNIVERSE - DARK\n\nA pure black screen.\n\nNARRATOR\nThis is a representation of the universe.\nIn this representation the information needed to explain everything is stored entirely in time.\nWe can sit here and let I can talk for an infinite amount of time until I have explained everything to you but it is not much to look at.\nLet's convert some of the information into space.\n\nA single white speck pops into existence in the center of the screen.\n\nNARRATOR\nA single point in space existing only for the tiniest infinitesimal of time.\nThat point has no meaningful spatial dimensions, but we have made it a little bigger so you can see it.\nThis is a unified grand theory looks like in spacetime.\nOne single piece of raw data that we can plug into a time equation that would define everything yet to happen to this point.\nThe realities of space and time are intertwined in ways that render the universe computationally irreducible.\nThis is not a model of all space and time as viewed from an omnipotent persepective.\nThis is a model of everything as it is viewed from a conscious perspective - filling not both space *and* time - but filling space *or* time.\n\nThe speck grows into a circular white line.\nAs the circle grows it begins fading from bright white into hues into red and blue representing hotter and colder areas in the cosmic microwave background.\nThe circle stops growing.\n\nNARRATOR\nThis circle has spatial dimension because we have used up some time to create it.\nYou have observed the passage of time, the expansion of space, and now your reference frame is no longer that of a single point.\nThe representational model we created is stored in the color of the points along the circle.\nSee the whole circle all at once by focusing on the center but percieving the outer limits.\nFocus your perspective on a single point along the edge to inspect it more closely.\nHold in your mind this single spatial frame of reference.\nBe the circle.\n\nThe circle disappears.\n\nNARRATOR\n...and whatever else time has in store.\n\nRevisiting this 2024-01-07 and I wrote the following:\n\nTrust and Citations in Academic Publishing: Workshop Guide\n\n\ncommand line basics\nAn introduction to command-line interfaces and basic POSIX commands.

A guide to implementing best practices in data analysis, including documentation, version control, and sharing code and data.\nhow to cite a superintelligence : why we cite\nscience-&gt; know (Latin) skepticism-&gt;search (Greek) cite -&gt;call (Latin)\nscientific thinking means having a huge amount of skepticism. trust absolutely only what your own data says. if you are to trust words, then you must establish sufficient shared experience. the most trustworthy scientific claims are ones you can and have tested yourself.\nAn ideal scientific publication makes one specific claim so well that any reader would be convinced, and so concisely that it would be an entertaining read.\nProblem: audience. We must rely on shared experiences to establish trust. This works best if you mostly already agree with the author. Citations can be used as a way to establish trust by citing authors, publishers, or results that the reader already agrees with. Word choice and use of familiar jargon can also establish a sense of shared experience with the reader.\nProblem: data. We must always be skeptical of data. Do we trust those who collected and published it? Can we collect it ourselves?\nHeuristic: - citing a person. means you have evaluated the trustworthiness of a person. - citing an org says I trust everyone in this org and the mechanations of the org - citing an AI says I trust everyone who contributed to the training data and the modeling method being used\nfact citation provenance\ntypes of citations • define a term (see here for clarification) • substantiate a claim (see here for justification) • data source (see here for raw data) • code\nAs a reader I want to __ so that __ - lookup the definition of a term - investigate the legitimacy of a claim - reproduce some results presented -"
