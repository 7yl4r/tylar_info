I posted on the discord of the “Lit” framework (my current favorite web components community) but nobody has replied.\nI went down a long rabbit hole trying to figure out how to build this thing, then decided that running the data through an AI would be better than getting all caught up on how to structure the data.\nThis feels like a pointless exercise I have gone through countless times over the last year or five; every time I start building something it gets more and more complex until I am overwhelmed. Trying to figure out the best way to build the user experience keeps landing me at AI and mesh-networked-IoTs. Those topics remain too big for me to tackle until I have collaborators. And so… I give up and go try to make my space more presentable. I am no longer able to maintain focus without another active participant and this stuff is way too far removed from anyone I know.\nBelow are a bunch of disjointed things I wrote while trying to get my thoughts together.\n\nHere is a lil sales pitch:\nYour personal reviews and recommendations are of more value today than ever.\nThis project allows you to reclaim ownership over that data.\nRecommend the works you trust, give discounts to your friends, and take commission for your influences.\n\nHere are the user stories for the minimum viable product:\n\nFind my preferred product supplier\n\nUser states: I want X\nSystem asks: Who do you trust about X?\n\nPublish an opinion\n\n\n\n\nWho do you trust to ask for a recommendation on X?\nNetwork of trusted suppliers, where each “supplier”\n\nI want to eliminate the process of getting multiple pricing quotes from untrusted suppliers.\n\nTo reduce that goal down a bit: I want to record my opinions about products I have viewed and reviewed so that I can order them again or share them with friends.

I wired up the following circuit\nmain --&gt; 30A_fuse --&gt; breaker_box --&gt; outlet\nAfter flipping it on I got not power at the outlet. The main tested working; there are no indicator lights on the fuse or breaker to help me debug. I have decided to try going through the fuse to the victron because it has indicator lights.\nAfter inspecting the AC in & AC out connections it looks as though I need a particular type of connector. note: I later found this was not the case. The manual does not specify what kind of connector it is. In this forum post acs calls it a “GST18 connector”. I have the 50A variant of the multiplus-II with 4-wire split-phase connectors but all the diagrams and photos I am seeing have 3-wire; I have the wrong manual. I am feeling anxious about connecting the unit without the 4th wire; I do not know if it was designed to function this way. I found the right manual and it does indeed say “The AC input can be supplied from a split-phase 120/240V source or a single-phase 120V source.” A big sigh of relief for that. I found a great install video here. Turns out these are “spring connectors” that the wire actually can go into directly."

How to speak computer : Machine Learning, systems engineering, code languages, and magic\nHere is a list of slide ideas: * underfitting, overfitting issues are pervasive * tech secret vendor lock-in * what is data, what is metadata? * hash functions + content addressable file systems * the semantic web * UML diagramming * user interface design * the linux philosophy * DRY * personal blogging & “research journaling”\nHere is a diagram where I tried getting at the different states of product development with the intention of talking about vendor lock-in and the incentives put onto code “owners”.\n---\ntitle: State Diagram for a Digital Products Creators\n---\ngraph TD\n\nstart((startup))\n%% MVP addresses &gt;=1 use case\nwriteCode(\"working on the magic\")\nsellCode(\"sold the magic\")\n\nleaseCode(\"sell use of \\n the magic\")\n\ndemoCode(\"give away the magic\")\n\n%% ======\nstart --&gt; writeCode\n\nwriteCode --&gt; sellCode\n\nwriteCode --&gt; leaseCode --&gt; writeCode\n\nwriteCode --&gt; demoCode --&gt; writeCode\nI am stuck at how to represent different levels of solution obfuscation and data harvesting in this diagram and I think I have lost sight of the purpose of this diagram. I need to take a step back and reconnect with what I want to communicate.\nHere is a bulleted list that inexplicably feels relevant: * data * metadata ontologies rely on a common semantic understanding * the problem of naming things * the “semantic web” makes the source of our shared understanding explicit * LLMs include mathematically encoded semantics\nBut what do I really want to communicate to anybody doing research? * The importance of establishing trusted sources of information. * Remembering your inability to perceive an objective reality\nHere is a screenplay:\nEXT.
